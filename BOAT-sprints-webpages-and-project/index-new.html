        <h2 class="section-title">Description of our Project</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Our project, "A Day In My Life" Journal, is a personal diary web application designed for
            individuals who want to document their daily experiences, emotions, and memories in a
            safe, digital space. The purpose of the platform is to make journaling more convenient and
            creative, allow users to track their mood patterns, and reflect on personal growth over time.
            Unlike traditional text-only journals, this system lets users express themselves through
            text, images, audio, or video entries while also tracking their mood and receiving daily
            motivational quotes.

        <h2 class="section-title">The Problem Our Website Will Solve</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Many people struggle to keep up with traditional journaling due to time, privacy, and
            organisation issues. Others want to go beyond text entries and include photos, voice notes,
            or short videos that reflect their day. Existing apps often lack these media types or require
            premium subscriptions.
            Our website solves this problem by providing an all-in-one, free, and user-friendly
            journaling system that securely stores text and multimedia entries in a database while also
            allowing users to view motivational quotes and analyse their emotional trends.
