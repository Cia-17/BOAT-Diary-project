Soft Accent Colors for date highlights:

Orange: #F4A261

Pink: #F7C6CE

Navigation Icons (inactive): #C7C7C7

Active Navigation Icon Background: #F4D35E

Event Card Backgrounds:

🧩 Design Principles
Layout


Maintain ample white space between sections.

Ensure consistent padding (e.g., 16px–20px) around all sections.

All cards, date bubbles, and containers should have rounded corners (12–20px).

Typography

Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Inter).

Calendar month title: Semibold, 20px–22px

Day numbers: Regular, 14px–16px

Event titles: Bold/Semibold, 16px

Event dates: Regular, 12px, muted color (#8A8A8A)

Alignment

Everything should be left-aligned except for calendar elements which should be grid-centered.

Maintain consistent spacing between rows of the calendar grid.
